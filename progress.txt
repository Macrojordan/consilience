## Codebase Patterns
- Backend uses SQLite for persistence with data/conversations/consilience.db
- Storage layer maintains backward compatibility - all functions return dictionaries matching old JSON structure
- Message stage data is stored as JSON in the stage_data column
- Database connection uses row_factory for dict-like access to columns
- Init_db() is called on module import in backend/database.py
- Council process runs in stages: Stage 1 (collect responses), Stage 1.5 (cross-examination), Stage 2 (rankings), Stage 3 (synthesis)
- run_full_council returns 5-tuple: (stage1, stage1_5, stage2, stage3, metadata)
- Streaming endpoints emit events: stage1_start/complete, stage1_5_start/complete, stage2_start/complete, stage3_start/complete

## 2026-01-11 21:26:54 - US-001
- Implemented SQLite adapter for conversation storage
- Created backend/database.py with connection management and schema initialization
- Refactored backend/storage.py to use SQLite while maintaining identical API
- Files changed: backend/database.py (new), backend/storage.py (refactored)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The storage layer API is now backed by SQLite but returns the exact same dictionary structures
  - All SQL queries use parameterized statements for safety
  - Database is automatically initialized on first import
  - Messages table uses stage_data TEXT column to store JSON for stages 1-3
  - The CASCADE delete ensures messages are cleaned up when conversations are deleted

## 2026-01-11 21:30:42 - US-002
- Updated add_assistant_message signature to accept optional stage1_5 parameter
- Modified stage_data JSON construction to include stage1_5 when provided
- Updated get_conversation to return stage1_5 data from assistant messages
- Files changed: backend/storage.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The stage1_5 data follows same pattern as stage1/stage2/stage3 - stored in stage_data JSON column
  - Optional parameters maintain backward compatibility with existing calls
  - Assistant messages now support dynamic stage fields via conditional JSON construction
  - get_conversation conditionally includes stage1_5 in response only when present in database

## 2026-01-11 21:36:59 - US-003
- Implemented dynamic model configuration loading from environment variables
- Updated backend/config.py to load COUNCIL_MODELS from COUNCIL_MODELS environment variable as JSON
- Added JSON parsing with fallback to default model list if parsing fails or variable not set
- Verified all backend modules (council.py, openrouter.py) already use imported config variables
- Tested FastAPI server startup to confirm changes work correctly
- Files changed: backend/config.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - COUNCIL_MODELS can now be configured via environment variable: `COUNCIL_MODELS='["model1", "model2"]'`
  - Config module provides graceful fallback to default models if environment variable is missing or malformed
  - Backend modules already use proper imports from config.py, no changes needed to consuming code
  - Server startup test confirms the dynamic configuration loads correctly at runtime
  - The backend/venv directory contains the Python virtual environment with all dependencies
---
## 2026-01-11 21:45:00 - US-004
- Implemented Stage 1.5 (Cross-Examination) between Stage 1 and Stage 2
- Created stage1_5_cross_examination function in backend/council.py that prompts each model to critique all responses
- Updated run_full_council to return 5 values including stage1_5_results
- Updated backend/main.py send_message endpoint to handle stage1_5 data
- Updated backend/main.py send_message_stream endpoint to emit stage1_5_start and stage1_5_complete events
- Updated storage.add_assistant_message calls to pass stage1_5 parameter
- Files changed: backend/council.py, backend/main.py
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Stage 1.5 runs after Stage 1 and before Stage 2 in the council process
  - The cross-examination prompt shows model names (not anonymized) to encourage thorough critique
  - Each council model receives all Stage 1 responses and provides critiques identifying errors, flaws, missing info, etc
  - Stage 1.5 results are stored in the same stage_data JSON column as other stages
  - The streaming endpoint emits stage1_5_start and stage1_5_complete events for real-time UI updates
  - run_full_council now returns a 5-tuple: (stage1, stage1_5, stage2, stage3, metadata)
